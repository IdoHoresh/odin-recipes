    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Why buy the boxed stuff when you can make noodles at home? This homemade pasta recipe is way better than what you can buy at the store — and it’s surprisingly easy to throw together with just five ingredients you 
        likely already have on hand!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul> 

    <h3>Steps</h3>  

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>Mix flour, eggs, olive oil, and salt in a bowl until combined. Add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, to flour mixture until a smooth, thick dough forms.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 10 minutes. Let dough rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 8 balls; use a pasta machine to roll and cut dough into desired pasta shape.</li>
    </ol>
